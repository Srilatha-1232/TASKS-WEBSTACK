# I am learning the MERN stack, and as part of completing each course, I want to continuously test and improve my skills. To do this, I asked ChatGPT to generate 150 task titles for practice.

# These 150 tasks are divided into three categories:

# Basic: 50 tasks

# Intermediate: 50 tasks

# Advanced: 50 tasks

# In total, there are 150 task titles that I will implement by coding to evaluate and strengthen my understanding.

# The first set of 150 tasks is based on HTML.

# By using each task title, I first understand the expected output through a reference image. Based on that image, I then write the code to match the expected result and implement the design accordingly.

# Task 1: Personal Profile Page using HTML – Completed ✅
